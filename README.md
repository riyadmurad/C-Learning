# C-Learning
This repository contains resources and materials for learning the C programming language. It includes tutorials, examples, and exercises to help beginners and intermediate programmers enhance their C programming skills.

# Contents
- `Labs/`: Sample C programs demonstrating different concepts.

# Getting Started
To start with C programming, you need to have a C compiler installed on your system. You can use GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) which is available for most operating systems or install Visual Studio Code with C/C++ extensions. Refer to the VCode documentation for setup instructions https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp.

# Hello World Example
A simple "Hello, World!" program in C looks like this:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```
Let's break down the code:
- `#include <stdio.h>`: This line includes the standard input-output library which is necessary for using the `printf` function.
- `int main() { ... }`: This is the main function where the execution of the program begins.
- `printf("Hello, World!\n");`: This line prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
- `return 0;`: This indicates that the program ended successfully.
